## Troubleshooting

### Command not found after installation

The installation script should have copied files to `~/.claude/commands/`. Verify:

```bash
ls ~/.claude/commands/tot.md
```

If the file is missing, try reinstalling:

```bash
npm uninstall -g @tot/cli
npm install -g @tot/cli
```

### Permission errors

If you get permission errors during installation:

```bash
# macOS/Linux
sudo npm install -g @tot/cli

# Or use npx (no global install needed)
npx @tot/cli
```
